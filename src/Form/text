#Refactoring a beautiful form

Consider the form below, a simple one. Beautiful, isn't ?

---> EXIBITION OF COMPONENT.

Its features are restricted to the exibition of three inputs, validated when the submission button is pressed.

One of the ways to model it using React is shown here,

---> SHOW COMPONENT'S CODE

A really patient reading of the code above inform us the component is responsible for to render the inputs, to validate its data and to send it somewhere. 

In fact it works. However, to assign too much responsabilities for a single component can make the mantanability a difficult task.

Just the introduction of one single field and another validation rule require significant changes, violating the "Open/Closed principle"(insert link).







 - USE THE WORD "ERROR PRONE".

- It is also worth noting the long list of parameters in the function 'validateFields' (insert code tag).
